This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the profitability of a company based on its expenditure in R&D, administration, and marketing. Startups and small businesses are essential drivers of economic growth and innovation, but predicting the profitability of a new venture can be challenging due to the highly uncertain and volatile nature of the startup ecosystem.
To address this challenge, we utilized a dataset that includes the R&D spend, administration cost, marketing spend, and profit earned for 50 different companies.
We implemented five different machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Cross Decomposition (PLS Regression), Decision Trees Regressor, Neural Network (supervised), and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Our results show that the Decision Trees Regressor model performed the best, with a test set prediction accuracy of 95.84%, RSCV of 96.54%, and GSCV of 96.30%. The top variables in this model were R&D spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend. 
The model developed in this study can provide entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers with a reliable and repeatable approach to evaluating startup profitability. By using publicly available large-scale data and machine learning techniques, this project contributes to the literature by providing a data-driven and quantified approach to predicting startup profitability that can be applied to future ventures in a variety of industries.
